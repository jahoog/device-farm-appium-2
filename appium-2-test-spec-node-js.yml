# Phases are collection of commands that get executed on Device Farm.
phases:
  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your tests use.
  # Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device Farm are already installed.
  install:
    commands:
      # By default the Node.js version installed is 11.4.0, however we enable you to change it
      # using the Node version manager (nvm). An example "nvm" command below changes the version to 14.19.1
      - export NVM_DIR=$HOME/.nvm
      - . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh
      - nvm install 16

      # Unpackage and install the node modules that you uploaded in the test phase.
      - echo "Navigate to test package directory"
      - cd $DEVICEFARM_TEST_PACKAGE_PATH
      - npm install
      
      # This test execution environment uses Appium version 1.9.1 by default, however we enable you to change it using
      # the Appium version manager (avm). An example "avm" command below changes the version to 1.22.2.
      # For your convenience, we have preinstalled the following versions: 1.22.2, 1.19.0, 1.18.3, 1.18.1, 1.18.0, 1.17.1, 1.16.0, 1.15.1, 1.14.2, 1.14.1, and 1.13.0.
      # To use one of these Appium versions, change the version number in the "avm" command below to your desired version:
      - export APPIUM_VERSION=2.0.0-beta.71
      - avm $APPIUM_VERSION
      - mkdir /usr/local/avm/versions/$APPIUM_VERSION/node_modules/appium/bin
      - ln -s /usr/local/avm/versions/$APPIUM_VERSION/node_modules/.bin/appium  /usr/local/avm/versions/$APPIUM_VERSION/node_modules/appium/bin/appium.js
      
      # Install uiautomator2 driver for Android
      - appium driver install uiautomator2

  # The pre-test phase includes commands that setup your test environment.
  pre_test:
    commands:
      # We recommend starting appium server process in the background using the command below.
      # Appium server log will go to $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR directory.
      # The environment variables below will be auto-populated during run time.

      # Device Farm devices vary in what versions of Chrome and WebView they have.
      # By default, this test spec file will enable Appium to download the corresponding versions of Chromedriver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/
      # To override this behavior, feel free to set the CHROMEDRIVER_CDNURL environment variable to another CDN. For example:
      # - export CHROMEDRIVER_CDNURL=https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com
      # For more information, please see https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver#troubleshooting-chromedriver-download-issues
      # Moreover, Appium downloads Chromedriver using a feature that is considered insecure for multitenant environments.
      # This is not a problem for Device Farm because each test host is allocated exclusively for one customer, then terminated entirely.
      # For more information, please see https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/packages/appium/docs/en/guides/security.md
